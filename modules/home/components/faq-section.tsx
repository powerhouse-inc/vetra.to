    question: 'Do I need to know how to code?',
    answer:
      "No. Vetra is designed so that anyone on your team can use it through a chat-style interface. Just describe what you need in plain language. If you are a developer, you also have full access to the underlying code and can customize everything — but it's completely optional.",

    question: 'Is Vetra open source?',
    answer:
      'Yes, Vetra is fully open source. That means you can inspect every line of code, modify it, and run it on your own servers. Unlike most AI tools, the platform itself is open — not just the apps it creates.',

    question: 'What is Vetra Cloud?',
    answer:
      'Vetra Cloud is our hosted option — we run everything for you so you can focus on building. It handles storage, scaling, and backups automatically. If you prefer, you can also run Vetra on your own servers at any time.',

    question: 'Does Vetra support blockchain or crypto wallets?',
    answer:
