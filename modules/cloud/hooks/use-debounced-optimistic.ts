/**
 * Optimistic state with a debounced, serialized commit.
 *
 * Designed for UI elements where the user might rapidly change their mind
 * (e.g. radio groups bound to a server-side setting). Solves three problems
 * at once:
 *
 *   1. **Optimistic UI.** `value` flips to the user's latest intent
 *      immediately on `set(next)` — no waiting for the network.
 *   2. **Debounced commit.** Bursts of `set` calls within `delayMs` collapse
 *      into a single commit for the final value, so scrubbing through
 *      options doesn't flood the server with throwaway writes.
 *   3. **Serialized commits with queue + drain.** If a click lands while a
 *      previous commit is still resolving, the new target is queued and
 *      applied right after — never two commits in flight at once. This
 *      prevents server-side races where a stale write lands second and
 *      "switches the value back."
 *
 * On error, the optimistic override is dropped (UI snaps back to server
 * truth) and any queued target is discarded — silently retrying isn't
 * usually what the user asked for. Pass `onError` to surface a toast.
 *
 * On unmount, a still-pending debounced commit is flushed best-effort so
 * the user's last selection isn't silently lost.
